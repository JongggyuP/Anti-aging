In block/elevator.c, list_add(&rq->queuelist, entry) incurs Kerenl panic.
1. Adding the same request twice to the list 
2. Adding one of the fragmented request 
does not incur Kernel panic.
However, adding multiple different requests to the list incurs Kernel panic.
Also, changing to the next fragmented request in elv_dispatch_reqeust() also incurs Kernel panic.
